<h3>CHECKERS HYPER</h3>
<p>Our efforts in developing products, services and experiences that people love have made the Checkers brand relevant after almost a century of serving the Southern African market.</p>
  
       <p>From our much loved steakhouse classics, to our ever-expanding cellar of local and international wines, to our extensive range of award-winning cheeses: we’re proud to be the supermarket of choice for shoppers who enjoy the finer things. </p>
       
       <p>But it doesn’t stop there; we make sure every shopper enjoys value for their money by keeping the prices of basic commodities low. In fact, we’ve consistently gone beyond the retail status quo when our customers needed us. When bread prices spiralled out of control in 1990, for example, we immediately stepped in and subsidised the sale of every loaf of bread at our stores.</p>
